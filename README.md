## Introduction
This project evaluates current bike availability trends during a 24 hours period and seeks to predict bike availability for the NYC Citibike bike share system. The three main sections of this project include: explores the clustering Technique to sort the maximum bike availability across hours, a simple deterministic model, and two versions of machine learned models. Comparative evaluation of the models indicates that the machine learned model with advanced feature engineering indeed out-performs the deterministic and naive machine learning model. 

## Technologies 
Project is created with :
* Python language for scripting .
* Postgres SQL Database for storage in the backend .
* AWS to read / write intermediate data coming in from the API calls .
* Python Libraries Used : Sklearn , Pandas , Matplotlib
